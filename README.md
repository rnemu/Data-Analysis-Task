# DataFrame Joins and SQL Database Connection

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various types of joins between two DataFrames using Python and how to connect Python with an SQL database.

## Notebooks

### Task_1.ipynb
This notebook contains code demonstrating different types of joins between two DataFrames using Python's pandas library. The types of joins covered include:

- Inner Join
- Left Join
- Right Join
- Outer Join

### Task_2.ipynb
This notebook contains code to connect Python with an SQL database using the `sqlite3` library. It demonstrates how to:

- Establish a connection to an SQL database
- Create tables
- Insert data into tables
- Query data from tables
- Close the connection to the database

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks, you will need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
